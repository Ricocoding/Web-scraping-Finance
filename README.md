# Web-scraping-Finance
The primary goal of this collaborative project is to develop a versatile web scraping tool capable of extracting historical data (2023 YTD) from the US stock market for multiple stocks. In our demo, we showcase the functionality using NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) and TSLA (Tesla, Inc.) while comparing their performance with the SPY market index.

For detailed codes and guideline, please check out Web_scraping_Project.ipynb.
